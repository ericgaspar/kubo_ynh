Kubo was the first IPFS implementation and is the most widely used one today. Implementing the Interplanetary Filesystem - the Web3 standard for content-addressing, interoperable with HTTP. Thus powered by IPLD's data models and the libp2p for network communication. Kubo is written in Go.

### Feature

- Runs an IPFS-Node as a network service
- Command Line Interface to IPFS-Nodes
- Local Web2-to-Web3 HTTP Gateway functionality
- HTTP RPC API (/api/v0) to access and control the daemon
- IPFS's internal Webgui can be used to manage the Kubo nodes
